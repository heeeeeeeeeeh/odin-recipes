    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This meatloaf recipe doesn't take long to make at all, and it's very good!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup dried bread crumbs</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons prepared mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, onion, milk, bread crumbs, and egg in a large bowl,
        and season with salt and pepper. Press mixture evenly into the prepared
        loaf pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard together in a small bowl until
        smooth, and spread evenly over the meatloaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1
        hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle reads at
        least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
